Today we are talking with Edith Harbaugh, the CEO and Co-founder of LaunchDarkly, one of the first “feature flags as a service companies” where they offer a feature management platform aiming to help teams build better software. We’ll get some backstory on how she got into enterprise software and some of the lessons she learned building advanced enterprise features, including an elaborate Role Based Access Control system that ultimately missed the mark on simplicity. We also discuss the evolution of enterprise sales and the role of a salesperson as observed over her nearly 20 years of building software. Finally, in one of my favorite moments we talk about some instances founders need to be a little shameless, especially when dealing with enterprise buyers.

EnterpriseReady is hosted by Grant Miller, creator of EnterpriseReady and co-founder and CEO of [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com), who are powering the worlds best enterprise software.
