In this episode, Grant interviews [Gene Kim](https://itrevolution.com/faculty/gene-kim/), Co-founder and former CTO of [Tripwire](https://www.tripwire.com/). A giant in the world of DevOps, Kim is the author of the successful books, [The Unicorn Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-unicorn-project/) (2019), [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/) (2013),  and The DevOps Handbook (2016). Listen as Gene and Grant discuss how enterprise organizations should structure their internal development priorities, the rise of the DevOps ecosystem, and why software engineers shouldn’t be railroaded into learning complex systems like Kubernetes.
