Welcome back to the EnterpriseReady podcast, today our guest is [Zack Blum](https://twitter.com/zackblum), Founder and CEO of Fleetsmith. In the episode we dive into the founding story behind Fleetsmith and then move into how they brought the product to market. Given the nature of the business, the story of Fleetsmith is intertwined with lessons about what all companies should be doing for internal security. We also spend a good bit of time discussing how they’ve implemented user management by leveraging GSuite & Office365, as well as their approach to product assortment.
