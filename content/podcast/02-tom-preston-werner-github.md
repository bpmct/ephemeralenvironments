In this episode we interview Tom Preston-Werner, founder and former CEO of GitHub. We mainly focus on Tom’s time at GitHub, where he built and scaled one of the most important developer tool companies in the world. However, many might not realize that Github is also one of the most successful enterprise software companies of the modern era. With over half of their revenue coming from large enterprise deals.

[Tom Preston-Werner](https://twitter.com/mojombo) is co-founder and former CEO/CTO of GitHub. More recently he co-founded [Chatterbug](https://chatterbug.com/en/), a language learning platform. Tom is also the author of the wildly popular static site generator Jekyll.
