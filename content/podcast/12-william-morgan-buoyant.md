Welcome back to the EnterpriseReady podcast. Today we are talking with [William Morgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wmorgan/), CEO, and Founder of [Buoyant](http://buoyant.io/), a company that primarily focuses on contributing to the open-source ServiceMesh project, [Linkerd](https://Linkerd.io/). Linkerd was born out of William and his co-founder Oliver’s experience building infrastructure at Twitter, where they were responsible for reducing the frequency in which the infamous “Fail whale” surfaced. The opening portion of the episode gives us a unique look into how Twitter eventually scaled their platform with cloud-native technologies and how one of those patterns ultimately became the inspiration for Linkerd. We then go into the strategies of gaining adoption and viable business models for open-source based companies. We wrap up our conversation with a deeper look at the benefits of Linkerd, and how it’s function can provide value for any organization adopting a cloud-native approach to their architecture.

EnterpriseReady is hosted by Grant Miller, creator of EnterpriseReady and co-founder and CEO of [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com), who are powering the worlds best enterprise software.
