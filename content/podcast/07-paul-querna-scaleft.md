In this episode of EnterpriseReady we are speaking with Paul Querna, the CTO and Cofounder of ScaleFT, which was acquired by Okta not too long ago. Paul likes to say that ScaleFT is in the business of granting people and machines access to the systems and endpoints they should be reaching. We get some back story on the company’s founding and then we focus on the Zero Trust concepts that ScaleFT evangelized that have their roots in a white paper published by Google that defined a new model for enterprise security, called BeyondCorp. We dive pretty deep into why BeyondCorp is needed including the previous status quo including the origins of Access Control Lists and VPNs. It gets quite technical, but I found it to be a super interesting conversation and hopefully you will too. Finally we wrap up with a discussion of what it is like to integrate into a large vendor’s existing Go-to-market process.
