In this episode of the entepriseready podcast, we hear from [Michael Pryor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhpryor/) the founder and CEO of [Trello](https://trello.com/). Micheal has had an incredible career as one of the founders of FogCreek Software which has spun out products such as FogBugz, StackOverflow, Glitch and of course, Trello which was acquired by Atlassian for $425 million dollars back in 2017. We cover a wide range of topics primarily from the perspective of a bottom-up go-to-market approach. We start off with a bit of Michael’s background and then dive into his perspective on naming products, approaches to user management & SSO, disruptive pricing models and product assortment. I could have asked him questions for another 4 hours, so we’ll have to have him back on the show again in the future. I hope you enjoy the show!

EnterpriseReady is hosted by Grant Miller, creator of EnterpriseReady and co-founder and CEO of [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com), who are powering the worlds best enterprise software.
