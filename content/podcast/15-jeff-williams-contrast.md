In this episode of the EnterpriseReady Podcast we interview Jeff Williams, founder and CTO of [ContrastSecurity](https://contrastsecurity.com). We explore Jeff’s early career in cyber security where he worked as a security consultant as the internet started to gain early traction. From there, we dive into his founding role at a security consulting firm where he stayed very involved with the security community through his role as Global Chair of OWASP where he helped create the OWASP Top 10. 

We spend a lot of time exploring Jeff’s perspective on application security and how he’s trying to change the approach from outside-in to inside-out by focusing on code instrumentation.

Jeff also drops some tips about which compliance frameworks to pay attention to, how to build RBAC into your application by leveraging an application framework, insights into their top down go-to-market approach and how they roll out new products. It is a great listen, so I hope you enjoy the show.

EnterpriseReady is hosted by Grant Miller, creator of EnterpriseReady and co-founder and CEO of [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com), who are powering the worlds best enterprise software.
