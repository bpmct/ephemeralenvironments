## Content Principles 

Scaling a SaaS product to the enterprise is hard. Good content can help solve problems. 

EnterpriseReady aims to help SaaS companies solve problems around scaling to the enterprise before they start, through content containing best practices and lessons learned from like-industry companies past and present.

We are product people solving problems with content. For EnterpriseReady, content *is* our product and ultimately important.

## Content Principles
All EnterpriseReady content aims to be:

* **Approachable:** Don't assume reader has prior knowledge, spell out acronyms, establish understanding before deep diving.
* **Informative:** No fluff. Information should be valuable and applicable to the given topic.
* **Supported by Curated Examples:** Amplify best practices and lessons to learn (pros/cons) from existing SaaS products vs. opinions or individual point of views. 

## Referencing Industry Examples 

EnterpriseReady uses real examples from the SaaS industry to illustrate best practices. When referencing another company's model for a given topic in a given guide, please follow these guidelines.

* Include up to date company logo and link 
* Screenshots of products should be up to date
* Limit over-promotion of your own product. If you have a relevant example to share, we encourage it, but note that EnterpriseReady is not meant to be a forum for promoting products. Rather, it is a forum for guiding on best practices in the industry.

## Capitalization 

EnterpriseReady should be capitalized as one word when referencing the guide & two words when referencing the product milestone of being truly enterprise ready. 

## Setting up your environment

Run `hugo server`
